# bilidanmaku
A swift implementation of Bilibili danmaku tool on Mac

And which is inpsired by [BiliLiveTool](https://github.com/liuz430524/BiliLiveTool).

This project is still under development. But at least it runs, so compile and play with it :)

Attention: Now the dock icon and the system menubar is missing temporarily, and possibly forever.
This is a side-effect, cuz a new feature is added: the danmaku window stays on top-most even on
fullscreen-ed window or games. This feature is still under testing, so... How to quit the app,
simply `⌘+Q`. And by the way, if you closed the main window, you can reopen it by double clicking
the danmaku window.
